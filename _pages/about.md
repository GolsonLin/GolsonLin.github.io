My name is Guo-Sheng Lin, currently employed at Marvell with the title of Senior Engineer, Software Validation & Quality Assurance. In my role, I am primarily responsible for the development and deployment of automated testing scripts. I graduated from the Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics at National Taiwan University, specializing in biomedical spectroscopy. Additionally, I have taken courses related to chip design and processes, such as Computer-aided VLSI System Design, providing me with a solid background in the semiconductor industry.
